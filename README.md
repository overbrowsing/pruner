## Overview

This JavaScript utility optimizes image handling by stitching multiple images into a single canvas. It allows developers to use background images while enhancing performance and supporting sustainable web design practices. By reducing the amount of data transferred, it significantly improves loading times.

## Install

You can include **pruner.js** in your project either by downloading the files or using a CDN.

### Download

- **Minified**: [pruner.min.js](https://unpkg.com/prunerjs@1.0.0/dist/pruner.min.js)
- **Unminified**: Available in the source repository.

### CDN

Link directly to the minified version using Unpkg:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/prunerjs@1.0.0/dist/pruner.min.js"></script>
```

### Package Managers

You can also install **pruner.js** using npm:

```bash
npm install pruner --save
```

## How It Works

### Image and Attribute Requirements

1. **Attribute (`data-pruner`)**
  - **Purpose**: This attribute holds the configuration for each image element in JSON format.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `imageName`: The base name of the images used in conjunction with the image (string).
    - `cols`: Number of columns (integer).
    - `rows`: Number of rows (integer).
    - `tileWidth`: Width of each tile in pixels (integer).
    - `tileHeight`: Height of each tile in pixels (integer).
    - `mobileBreakpoint`: The screen width in pixels below which the mobile image is loaded (integer).
    - `mobileScale`: Scale factor for mobile view (optional, numeric).
    - `imagePath`: Path to the directory where images are stored (string).

2. **Images**
  - **Name**: Ensure that `imageName` matches the base name used for the pruner tile images. For instance, if `imageName` is `landscape`, the images should be named `landscape 1.webp`, `landscape 2.webp`, and so on.
  - **File**: All image formats are supported; however, we recommend using a modern image format like WebP for improved optimisation and a more sustainable web design.


## Pruning Results

### Performance Results

**Before and After Using Pruner.

- **Original (Desktop and Mobile)**: 244 KB
- **Optimized with Pruning**: 154 KB (36.89% reduction)

*Note: The number of visible tiles can vary with viewport size. Additionally, the size reduction achieved through pruning depends on the amount of detail in the visible tiles; larger or less detailed tiles may affect the optimisation results. The optimized image size reflects the reduction achieved through pruning. Testing is ongoing to further optimize and verify the results.*

## Initialize

You can initialize **pruner.js** using vanilla JavaScript or by setting attributes in your HTML.

### With Vanilla JavaScript

```javascript
window.onload = () => {
  new Pruner('data-pruner');
};
```

### Example HTML Setup

You can use the `data-pruner` attribute to configure how the image is processed.

```html
<img data-pruner='{"imageName": "landscape", "cols": 5, "rows": 5, "tileWidth": 300, "tileHeight": 200, "mobileBreakpoint": 768, "mobileScale":1.4, "imagePath": "assets/"}' alt="Landscape photography of mountains in New Zealand by Tobias Keller" loading="lazy">
```

- **Attribute**: `data-pruner`
  - `imageName`: `landscape` pixels
  - `cols`: `5` (5 columns)
  - `rows`: `5` (5 row)
  - `tileWidth`: `300` pixels
  - `tileHeight`: `200` pixels
  - `mobileBreakpoint`: `768` pixels
  - `imagePath`: `/assets/` (path to images)

### Usage

1. **Include `pruner.js`** in your HTML file:
   ```html
   <script src="path/to/pruner.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Set Up Images**:
   - Ensure that `imageName` matches the base name used for the pruner tile images. For instance, if `imageName` is `landscape`, the images should be named `landscape 1.webp`, `landscape 2.webp`, and so on.
   - Add the `data-pruner` attributes to the image, specifying the name of the image, the number of columns, rows, tile width, tile height, mobile breakpoint, mobile scale factor, and image path.

### Mobile Optimization

On mobile devices (below the `mobileBreakpoint`), only the central tiles of the grid are loaded for improved performance. This is determined by the `mobileScale` parameter, which adjusts the scaling of the tiles based on the deviceâ€™s screen size. For larger screens, the entire tiled image grid is constructed and displayed on a canvas.
