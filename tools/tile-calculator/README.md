# üëí Tile Calculator

## Overview

Tile Calculator is a Python application that helps users determine the optimal tile dimensions images using `pruner.js` not only at defined breakpoints but also dynamically across a variety of viewport sizes, distinguishing it from traditional responsive image methods.

## How it Works

- **Retrieving Viewport Sizes**: The script begins by retrieving the five most common viewport sizes for mobile, tablet, and desktop from from [Statcounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/screen-resolution-stats), along with some secondary sizes for added flexibility
- **Calculating Potential Tile Sizes**: It calculates potential tile widths and heights by identifying all common divisors of the viewport dimensions. This helps determine how many tiles fit in the viewport and the overhang in both width and height.
- **Minimising Pixel Waste**: The tool tests different tile size combinations to find the one that results in the lowest average pixel waste. Pixel waste refers to the unused pixels that remain when an image does not perfectly align with the viewport.
- **Calculating Final Results**: After determining the best tile dimensions, the script calculates the average pixel waste percentage and displays the results, including the tile layout (columns and rows), tile dimensions, total number of tiles, and the average pixel waste across all tested viewport sizes.

## Initialize

1. **Run the Script**

To use the script, simply run the Python file or execute using the command:

```bash
python tools/tile-maker/tile-calc.py
```

2. **Follow the Prompts**

Once executed, you will be prompted (‚ùì) to enter the desired image width and height:

**‚ùì Enter the desired largest image width (px)**

**‚ùì Enter the desired largest image height (px)**

3. **View Results**

The script will output:

- Image dimensions
- Number of columns and rows
- Total tiles
- Tile dimensions
- Average pixel waste

## Example

The inputs below generated the calculation for tiles featured in the [example setup](/README.md#example-installation):

- Dimensions: 2400 x 1500px

The printed results from the example setup:

```bash
Tile calculation complete!
Image dimensions = 2400 x 1500px
Columns = 10, Rows = 8
Total tiles = 80
Tile dimensions = 240.00 x 187.50px
Average pixel waste = 20.38%
```
